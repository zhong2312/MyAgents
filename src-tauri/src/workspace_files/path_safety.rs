//! Workspace path resolution and traversal protection.
//!
//! All workspace file commands take an absolute `workspace_path` (the directory
//! the user is currently working inside) and a `relative` path or `target_dir`
//! the operation should affect. This module is the single chokepoint that turns
//! that pair into a validated absolute path that:
//!
//! 1. Resolves `..` and `.` components (no traversal escape).
//! 2. Stays inside `workspace_path` (no escape via symlink-aware canonicalization
//!    where the file already exists; for new paths we walk component-by-component).
//! 3. Passes the same system / credential directory blacklist used everywhere
//!    else in the app — see `commands::validate_file_path`.
//!
//! Centralizing these rules means a future "ah, also block X" only happens once.
//! Callers MUST go through `resolve_inside_workspace`; bypassing it is a bug.
//!
//! Symlink note (Phase D + Phase D.5):
//! - **Lexical resolve** (`resolve_inside_workspace`): for write-side commands
//!   (`new_file`, `new_folder`, `rename`, `move`, gitignore append, etc.) the
//!   target may not exist yet, so we resolve `..`/`.` lexically and check
//!   `starts_with(workspace_root)`. A symlink inside the workspace pointing
//!   outside is reachable — consistent with the prior sidecar behavior and
//!   with what users expect when they put a symlink in their own project.
//! - **Canonical resolve** (`resolve_existing_inside_workspace`): for read-side
//!   commands (`read_preview`, `download_file`) we canonicalize the resolved
//!   path AND the workspace root, then re-check `starts_with`. This blocks
//!   the "malicious repo with `evil_link → /etc/passwd`" attack: cloning a
//!   repo means the workspace root is trusted, but individual symlinks
//!   inside it are not. Read-only commands have no legitimate need to follow
//!   them outside.
//!
//! The same canonicalize trick can't apply to write-side commands because
//! `fs::canonicalize` fails on paths that don't exist yet.
