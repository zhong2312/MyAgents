/**
 * Unified log retention policy for `~/.myagents/logs/`.
 *
 * Single source of truth for retention across all log sources the Sidecar
 * writes. Replaces v0.2.7's split between `UnifiedLogger.cleanupOldUnifiedLogs`
 * (unified file cleanup) and `AgentLogger.cleanupOldLogs` (per-session
 * cleanup) — those duplicated the age-cutoff logic, applied different
 * (or absent) byte budgets, and ran independently on startup so behavior
 * across sources was incoherent.
 *
 * Sources covered here:
 *
 *   - `unified`  — `unified-{date}.log` plus rotated `unified-{date}.{ts}.log`.
 *                  Captures merged React/Node/Rust output. The actively-
 *                  writing file is protected by name (the only source where
 *                  this matters; sessions never collide on filename).
 *
 *   - `session`  — `{date}-{sessionId}.log`. Per-session AgentLogger output.
 *                  v0.2.7 had **no byte budget at all** for these — a power
 *                  user with hundreds of sessions could fill disk silently.
 *                  Now bounded.
 *
 * Crash artifacts (`~/.myagents/logs/crash/*.log`) have a separate policy
 * owned by the always-present Tauri application process. Node Sidecars only
 * own their individual lazy writer and single-file ceiling; they never race
 * to evict files from the shared directory.
 *
 * Policy per source (each independent):
 *
 *   - `maxAgeMs`   hard age ceiling — files older than this are deleted
 *                  regardless of any other consideration. The cheap
 *                  predictable retention.
 *
 *   - `maxBytes`   total byte budget for the source. When the source is
 *                  over budget, evict oldest-by-mtime files UNTIL EITHER
 *                  total falls below budget OR every remaining file is
 *                  inside the floor (see below).
 *
 *   - `floorMs`    protected recent window. Files modified within this
 *                  window are NEVER evicted by the byte budget, even if
 *                  total exceeds it. Fundamental safety: when a user is
 *                  actively debugging, the logs they need to see are
 *                  always there. The age cutoff still applies, but it's
 *                  much larger than the floor by design (`maxAgeMs >>
 *                  floorMs`).
 *
 *   - `protectActiveFile`  when true, the actively-writing file is also
 *                  protected from byte-budget eviction (race-defense:
 *                  rotation just renamed it, mtime might be older than
 *                  expected). Required for `unified`; not for `session`
 *                  (per-session has no single "active" path — many
 *                  sessions write concurrently — and they all fall
 *                  inside the floor anyway).
 *
 * The sweep is idempotent and safe to run any time. Sidecar runs it on
 * startup and on a 1-hour timer; this catches gradual growth without
 * waiting for a 50MB rotation event (the v0.2.7 trigger), and runs even
 * when the user is light enough that no rotation ever happens.
 *
 * Issue #121 (2026-05): the v0.2.7 split + missing per-session budget
 * meant a heavy user could lose recent unified logs to silent budget
 * eviction, while session logs grew without bound. Symptoms looked like
 * "the upgrade ate my logs" because eviction happened on the next
 * Sidecar startup after the upgrade. Unifying retention makes both
 * failure modes structurally impossible.
